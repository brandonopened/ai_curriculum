basics of curriculum generated AI
Essentially, I want to create a corpus of text for accomodations for specific populations - I'm going to start with ELD, Special Education, and Spanish curricular supports. 

I'll import a few good lesson plans from SFUSD with proper sourcing and see if I can use services like GPT3, automatic translators etc to take the original text and create NEW lesson plans incorporating specific curricular supports on the fly for those populations. 

eventually I'd want to be able to point to a google doc or a word file etc and have it generate lessons for various populations dynamically.
