{"text": "Allowing students to translanguage, or alternate, between English and their native language is an essential strategy for English language learners. In the classroom, English language learners can often feel intimidated when asked to speak, so when students are allowed to use their first language to help produce their second language, it lessens some of the anxiety that can occur.[47] Often times in the classroom, teachers ask students to communicate complex ideas and translanguing helps students do this. In this case, teachers are not concerned so much about their language output, but rather if they are able to communicate their ideas.[48] By allowing students to translanguage in the classroom, it allows students to process and convey their ideas in a lower-risk output situation (worksheets) that can lead to more high-risk output situations (essays and projects).[48]When it comes to writing, constant and a variety of feedback needs to be given. This could be about syntax or sentence structures, which feedback could be given on a rubric.[49] Modeling effective writing is also an essential strategy, which can be done by vocalizing their reasoning for choice in vocabulary, sentence structure, and even purpose for writing.[49] Teachers should chunk writing steps into manageable sections for English language learners.[49]Technology usage in the classroom can be beneficial for English language learners.Incorporating technology is one strategy for supporting English-Language Learners in the classroom. The internet makes it possible for students to view videos of activities, events, and places around the world instantaneously. Viewing these activities can help English-Language Learners develop an understanding of new concepts while at the same time building topic related schema (background knowledge).[50] Introducing students to media literacy and accessible materials can also aid them in their future academic endeavors and establish research skills early on. This can also help students visually as well. For English language learners, listening all the time can become very taxing, so teachers should add in visual as much as they can to support students.[51] Technology allows teachers to do this because images can be projected on the screen as well as text when learning new concepts. Experiential learning is another strategy to support ELL students. The teacher can provide opportunities for English Language Learners to acquire vocabulary and build knowledge through hands-on learning.[52] This can include activities such as science experiments and art projects, which are tactile ways that encourage students to create solutions to proposed problems or tasks.
A strategy that requires more involvement from educators is supporting the students outside of the school setting. To respond to deficiencies in the public school system, educators and student activists have created spaces that work to uplift ELL and their families. Labeled as family-school-community partnerships, these spaces have sought out cultural and linguistic responsiveness through encouraging participation and addressing needs outside of school. It is an interpretation of growth through art and community bonding meant to prime student development.[53]", "label": "Positive", "metadata": {"source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_learner"}}
